building two websites — one for inventory management and another for e‑commerce, both centered on recycling temple waste in
collaboration with NGOs. You want crisp, catchy lines that capture the mission and vision.

**Mission**: Tracking every temple offering and waste item seamlessly with live monitoring, automated segregation, and hygienic
IoT bins—ensuring timely, clean, and responsible waste collection from temples for effective recycling and environmental protection.​
This mission merges cutting-edge live tracking with sustainable practices and cleanliness, emphasizing automated systems and regular, timely collection to maximize recycling impact.


**Vision**: To create a clean, hygienic, and transparent temple environment where every offering is tracked, all waste is live-monitored and automatically segregated, and IoT-enabled bins ensure safe and sustainable recycling—so temples lead the way to a zero-waste, eco-friendly future supported by community, technology, and faith. This vision embraces innovation and spiritual responsibility, making environmental stewardship an everyday reality in places of worship.
